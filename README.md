[This project](https://ray-marching-scene.vercel.app/) is a simple 3D scene created using ray marching technique, implemented with [WebGL](https://webgl2fundamentals.org/) and [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). The goal of this project is to demonstrate the power and flexibility of ray marching technique in creating visually interesting 3D scenes.

### Ray Marching

Ray marching, also known as ray marching distance fields, is a technique used in computer graphics to render 3D scenes. It is a variation of ray tracing, where instead of tracing the path of rays of light from a camera to a surface, it iteratively steps along the ray direction and evaluates the distance function of the scene.
